This is a git refresher repository

## Reason for Course

I am taking this to help me get better at git and github


## Some Git commands
1. **git clone *plus https address***: Clones repo from github to local repository
2. **git status**: Shows all the files that were updated or created or deleted, but haven't been saved on git yet
3. **git add *(add '.' to tell git to track all the files)***: This is used to track files before it is saved to git
